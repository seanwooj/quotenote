upload ux should be improved
should add a button that says upload
want a modal to open when you click on "upload image"


background selection should be improved
see all of the images in one box
possiby a scroll down 3x2

when you upload a new photo it should be the first one that has come up.

login modal is wonky, needs to be styled
put a sign up button next to sign in button on top bar

going through the flow
sign up page causes a redirect loop
can we grab first and last name
auto email after sign up

account option next to sign out button (edit user profile, etc)

account drop down menu

can we change the name of the file that is saved when you click on download?
- [quote_text].jpg

font picker is weirdly styled

eventually - share buttons
possibly watermark

when you click out of a box, if it has already generated the querystring, then do not reload

change the first image
maybe change the color
