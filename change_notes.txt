X upload ux should be improved
X should add a button that says upload

background selection should be improved
see all of the images in one box
possiby a scroll down 3x2

when you upload a new photo it should be the first one that has come up.

login modal is wonky, needs to be styled
put a sign up button next to sign in button on top bar

going through the flow
sign up page causes a redirect loop
can we grab first and last name
auto email after sign up

account option next to sign out button (edit user profile, etc)

account drop down menu

can we change the name of the file that is saved when you click on download?
- [quote_text].jpg

font picker is weirdly styled

eventually - share buttons
possibly watermark

when you click out of a box, if it has already generated the querystring, then do not reload

change the first image
maybe change the color


add styles for the notices
add a style for section headers






TWO
change the font box
X sign in and login button both

when signed in, have an account dropdown

fix the pictures, somehow - rank 2
font selection is oversized. fix

image load is pretty slow

there is no context for the site. - we need to somehow provide context.
- change the flash message when purchase is clicked

how do we want to display the products?

X product selection needs to be worked on. - taken care of for now. one product only.

we need to provide the product information

build a landing page.

we need an order confirmation page.
and email confirmations

X we need to have a person login on the checkout


X delete an item from cart **
